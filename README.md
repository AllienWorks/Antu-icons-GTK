# Antu GTK

![Antu icons GTK](antu-icons-preview.svg)

Continuation of [@franksouza183](https://github.com/franksouza183)'s Antu icon theme, which was taken offline for some reason. Originally for KDE, Antu Heritage extends support to Gtk desktops and new apps. A lot of the icons are just symlinked to their KDE counterparts. The missing ones are on TODO (feel free to open Issues with requests for your missing apps).

> Thanks to @franksouza183 for original work on Antu icons and @jcqSCH for sharing them afterwards!

As a user of dark UIs, I'm currently working only on `AntuDark` variant. The others are kept as they were, for future work.

## Installation

1. clone or download ZIP of this repo
2. copy folders to either `~/.icons/` (for your user only) or to `/usr/share/icons/` (for all users)
